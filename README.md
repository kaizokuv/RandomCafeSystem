## Why this exists
The first of many random posts that track my progress as a programmer. Starting off first, a simple ordering system based on python, a quick refresh on my skills for programming :D

The base of this stems from how I wanted to improve my skills in coding, and be more fluent, and so I figured, instead of being stuck in tutorial hell, might as well just code, and if something broke, I would learn to fix it.

So behold the first of many repos to come about my progress and improvement. If anyone who sees this has any tips, ideas or comments, just lemme know, all feedback is much appreciated.

## How to run
- git clone https://github.com/kaizokuv/RandomCafeSystem.git
- cd RandomCafeSystem
- python3 main.py
